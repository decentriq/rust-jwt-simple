This branch is a stripped down version of the master branch. The jwt-simple crate cannot be used in the enclave as it has a dependency on [coarsetime](https://crates.io/crates/coarsetime/0.1.23) which depends on OS specifics. An example is https://github.com/jedisct1/rust-coarsetime/blob/720c2d19377fab64574fdf5a68688c83430dcdd8/src/instant.rs#L130-L138.

The bare minimum amount of code has been included. Currently this means that only the RS256 algorithm is supported for JWT signing.
